\section{Conclusion}

Throughout this project we have built a working multi cycle MIPS processor. The processor
has been proven to work both in the simulation, ModelSim, and near production, FPGA Development board, environment.
The design of the processor has shown itself to be extensible through the development of extra
features. And as it supports logical and arithmetic instructions alongside conditional branches, 
the architecture is therefore a general purpose computer and can compute all computable functions.
