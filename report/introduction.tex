\section{Introduction}

In this report the processes of realizing a processor with a subset of 
the MIPS Instruction Architecture is described. The instructions are listed 
in (ref). The attached project is a Xilinx Integrated Software Environment 
project containing a generated MicroBlaze\footnote{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroBlaze} 
core and simple multi cycle MIPS core written in VHDL. The MicroBlaze core provides 
communication between a PC through a COM port and the MIPS core. Testbenches and 
test programs are provided to verify the correctness of the implementation. 

The system has been tested on a Xilinx Spartan 6 FPGA\footnote{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xilinx\#Spartan\_family}, 
and with the timing simulator ModelSim.
