\section{Introduction}

This report describes the implementation of a pipelined processor core with realizing a subset of the MIPS Instruction Architecture as outlined in section \ref{sec:isa}. Attached is the project developed in the Xilinx Integrated Software Environment. The project contains a generated MicroBlaze core and a pipelined MIPS core written in VHDL with testbenches for each entity. The MicroBlaze\footnote{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroBlaze} core provides communication between a PC through a COM port and the MIPS core. Testbenches and test programs are provided to verify the correctness of the implementation. 

The system has been tested on a Xilinx Spartan 6 FPGA\footnote{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xilinx\#Spartan\_family}, and with the timing simulator ModelSim.
