\section{Abstract}

This report expains the design, implementation and testing of a pipelined
processor design following the MIPS architecture on a FPGA platform.
Our goal is to support a large enough subset of the MIPS instruciton set
to be able to do general computation. We want to optimize our pipeline design
by including units that minimizes delay due to hazards and data dependecies.
