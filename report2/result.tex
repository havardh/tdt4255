\section{Results}

All testbenches are implemented as selftesting testsbenches. They contain 
asserts which verify that the expected output has been generated. For the 
low level components the tests are implemented as simple signal assignments 
and assertions. Integration tests are written at the toplevel, here small 
testprograms are loaded into the instruction memory with test data loaded
into data memory, the processor is then enabled for a while. Finally the 
resulting memory state is checked using assert functions.

The test benches are presented in a bottom-up order, and a screenshot is 
provided per testbench. For the higher level 
units or units which contains states, the screenshot is included in the report
and the result is described in more detail. The lower level tests have their test bench results combined into an attached .zip-file, and can be used for easy verification that all assertions pass.
