\section{Conclusion}

With this project we have succesfully implemented a pipeline MIPS processor. It has been proven to work well both with simulations and on an FPGA chip. We focused on optimizing the processor with regards to hazards associated with pipelining, and the resulting processor is faster than a multicycle processor. The processor supports logical and arithmetic instructions, and is therefore usable in a general purpose computer.
