\section{VHDL implementation}

\subsection{Required Implementation}
The implementation is divided between the tree main files {\bf processor.vhd}, {\bf control\_unit.vhd} and {\bf alu\_control.vhd}. In addition the project contains the support components {\bf shiftleft.vhd} and {\bf sign\_extend.vhd}. All these components has been implemented after the requirements for the assignment. For these only bugfixes discoverd through writing testbenches will be changed. 

\subsection{Additional Features}
A jump and link instruction to implement functions.
