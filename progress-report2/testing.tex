\section{Testing}

\subsection{Testbenches}
Testbenches for all files implemented as well as a revamped toplevel testbench has
been created. All of our testbenches including the toplevel testbench are fully
automated using assertions.

\subsection{Physical tests}
Test programs has been written during the development of the code this far, and 
tests on physcal hardware has been done at important milestones. We still need
to perform a final larger test once all our components are completed.
