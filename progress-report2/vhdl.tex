\section{VHDL implementation}

\subsection{Required Implementation}
The implementation is divided between several files. We got one file per hazard
unit, forward, hazard detection and branch prediction unit. We've got one file
for each of the four pipeline registers with the simple logic related to these,
and finally a file per pipeline stage minus the memory stage which is implemented
directly in the processor. 

Of these everything except hazard detection related to conditional branches is 
fully implemeneted and tested.

\subsection{Additional Features}
We are planning to implement the two extra instructions we did last time, jump
and link and jump register. In addition to these we want to implement both
shifting and rotating.

For branch prediction we are going to make use of the state based system that 
was presented in the lectures.
